When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This will allow publishing your work as well as creating a remote backup of your work.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 	forks: 
 	These are a GitHub specific feature. It enables to create a copy of a repository on GitHub. I would use it to add custom changes to a repository without changing the master.

 	clones: 
 	These allow you to create a local copy of the repository in Git. I would use this to edit a repository locally.
 	
 	branches: 
 	These allow you to work on a specific objective without affecting the master repository.
 	I will use this for a bug fix or a completely new development based on the master.
